CodeGuide is a web application where you can look for syntaxes and tricks of different programming languages like Javascript, Python, CSS3, MongoDB, etc.

To start the web app you must install all modules by using the command `npm install` then `node app.js` and look for `localhost:3000` in the browser.

The client-side was build using HTML5, CSS3 and pure Javascript. The only this party library used was font-awesome for the icon. The server-side was build using NodeJS and ExpressJS. Since I didn't want to use a view template, I made a view template-like using plain Javascript and HTML5.
